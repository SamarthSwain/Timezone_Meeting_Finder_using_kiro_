# Timezone_Meeting_Finder_using_kiro-
I've build a clean, elegant single-purpose website.  created a Timezone Meeting Finder - it helps you find the perfect meeting time across different timezones, solving that annoying problem of coordinating calls with people around the world.



I've built a Timezone Meeting Finder that solves the annoying problem of coordinating meetings across different timezones.

What it does:

Automatically detects your timezone
Lets you add multiple locations with custom names
Drag a slider to pick a meeting time
Shows everyone's local time with color coding (green = good hours, yellow = early/late, red = sleeping hours)
